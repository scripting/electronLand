Added config.flPreventHardwareAcceleration per Scott Hanson's <a href="https://github.com/scripting/electronLand/issues/3#issue-1352977828">request</a>. 

Also added source.opml to the repository, which has become my convention -- it contains the outline that I edit the project in.

Fixed <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/releases/stable?version=6&page=5#release-notes-for-600">breakage</a> in shellNewFileDialog, shellChooseFolderDialog, shellOpenFileDialog.

Fixed some hard-coded icons used with Font-Awesome. Upgrading to the new version caused breakage.

Made public along with the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/55">release</a> of <a href="https://github.com/scripting/electricPork">electricPork</a> as open source. The goal is to port electronLand to platforms other than the Mac.
